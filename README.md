## Reason for Starting the Project

I had a cycle that got lost many times even though it was locked. To prevent this and to monitor my cycle's location, I decided to create the Cycle Management System.

## Uses of the App

- **View Cycling Routes**: 
  - Track your location and navigate easily using Google Maps.
  
- **SOS Feature**: 
  - Stay safe during your cycling trips with the SOS feature, which allows you to quickly send alerts to emergency contacts. 
  - This is mainly useful for people who are riding cycles in mountainous areas and rough terrains for their safety.    ![image](https://github.com/saikrishy3808u3qr3pur3q/Cycle-Management-Sysytem/assets/114069009/f5790609-2907-4930-ab5d-7d75dde97d50)

  
- **Parental Monitoring**: 
  - Parents can monitor their children and know where they are for safety purposes.
  
- **Participate in Cycling Contests**: 
  - Track your progress, compete with others, and view leaderboard rankings.
  
- **Unique Features**: 
  - Include any other unique features of your cycle management system, such as custom route planning or group ride coordination.



## Future Development Scope

- **Automatic Lock Systems**: Similar to car locks, if the user moves away to a certain distance, the cycle automatically locks. This feature uses the location data from the mobile phone and is optional for the user.

## Installation Process and Using It

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository**.
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**.
    ```sh
    cd cycle-management-system
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**.
    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```

4. **Update Firebase configuration**:
    - For Android: Update `google-services.json`.
    - For iOS: Update `GoogleService-Info.plist and other required runner files`.

5. **Run the app**.
    ```sh
    flutter run
    ```

This will start the application, and you can now use the Cycle Management System to monitor and manage your cycling activities.
